        + Any other application-specific
    + Mandatory
    
+ `requiredPermit` : This attribute captures what permit(s) might be needed to park at this site. Semantics
is that at least *one of* these permits is needed to park. When a permit is composed by more than one item (and)
they can be combined with a ",". For instance "residentPermit,disabledPermit" stays that both, at the same time,

        a blue zone which is only active on dayweeks will be encoded as "blueZonePermit": "Mo,Tu,We,Th,Fr,Sa 09:00-20:00".

## Examples of use

An on street parking which contains a group of parking spots reserved for disabled people.
At root entity level is announced that special parking spots for disabled are present and two of them free. 

Main `OnstreetParking` entity. 

    {
      "id": "santander:daoiz_velarde_1_5",
      "type": "OnStreetParking",
      "category": ["blueZone", "shortTerm", "forDisabled"],
      "allowedVehicleType": "car",
      "chargeType": ["temporaryFee"],
      "requiredPermit": ["blueZonePermit", "disabledPermit"],
      "permitActiveHours": {
        "blueZonePermit": "Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa 09:00-20:00"
      },
      "maximumAllowedStay": "PT2H",
      "availableSpotNumber": 3,
      "totalSpotNumber": 6,
      "extraSpotNumber": 2,
      "dateModified": "2016-06-02T09:25:55.00Z",
      "location": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            [-3.80356167695194, 43.46296641666926 ],
            [-3.803161973253841,43.46301091092682 ],
            [-3.803147082548618,43.462879859445884],
            [-3.803536474744068,43.462838666196674],
            [-3.80356167695194, 43.46296641666926]
          ]
        ]
      },
      "areaServed": "Zona Centro",
      "refParkingGroup: ["daoiz-velarde-1-5-main", daoiz-velarde-1-5-disabled"]
    }

Two different parking groups are needed in this case:

A/ Subrogated `ParkingGroup` which gives details about the regular parking spots

    {
      "id": "daoiz-velarde-1-5-main",
      "type": "ParkingGroup",
      "category": ["onstreet", "blueZone", "shortTerm"],
      "allowedVehicleType": "car",
      "chargeType": ["temporaryFee"],
      "refParkingSite": "daoiz-velarde-1-5",
      "totalSpotNumber": 4,
      "availableSpotNumber": 1,
      "requiredPermit": "blueZonePermit"
      /* Other required attributes */
    }


B/ Subrogated `ParkingGroup`. `refPArkingSite` is a pointer to the root entity. All the parking spots are free. 

    {
      "id": "daoiz-velarde-1-5-disabled",
      "type": "ParkingGroup",
      "category": ["onstreet", "blueZone", "shortTerm", "onlyDisabled"],
      "allowedVehicleType": "car",
      "chargeType": ["temporaryFee"],
      "refParkingSite": "daoiz-velarde-1-5",
      "description": "Two parking spots reserved for disabled people",
      "totalSpotNumber": 2,
      "availableSpotNumber": 2,
      "requiredPermit": "disabledPermit,blueZonePermit"
      /* Other required attributes */
    }
